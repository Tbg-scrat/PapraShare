PapraShare: Your files, your rules.

PapraShare is a lightweight, open-source utility that integrates perfectly with your Android device. It adds a dedicated target to your system's share menu, allowing you to upload images, documents, and files in an instant—whether to the official Papra platform or your very own private instance.

Important Note: This is an unofficial app provided by an independent developer. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected to the Papra project or its maintainers.

Why use PapraShare?

Flexibility: Use the official Papra instance for a quick start or connect to your private server for maximum data sovereignty.

Total Control: Your data goes exactly where you want it. No middlemen, no unwanted analytics.

Quick Setup: Simply enter the URL of your preferred instance and your API key, and you're good to go.

Seamless Integration: Share files directly from your Gallery, File Manager, or Browser using the standard Android share sheet.

Privacy First: The app collects no user data and requires no unnecessary permissions.

How it works:

- Configure your preferred instance (official or private) in the PapraShare settings

- Select a file in any app on your device

- Tap "Share" and select PapraShare

- Your file is securely transferred
